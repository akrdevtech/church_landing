                Pr. John George (Tinu George) was born to Georgekutty and Ponnamma George, as the youngest of three sons in Aranmula Kochuveedu at Kottarakara on 15th Dec 1981.<br /><br />

                He hailed from a traditional Marthomite family and all members of his family were active in Sunday School, Choir and other activities of the church. His mother was a pious woman and she was the motivating force in his prayer life.<br /><br />

                During a Pentecostal prayer meeting at the age of 18, Pr. Tinu George decided to accept Jesus Christ as his personal saviour and took water baptism. Later in college days, he earned many of his friends for Jesus Christ. He dedicated his life for Jesus Christ and began to fast for long periods. During one of these fasting days, he attended a meeting of an anointed man of God and got baptized in Holy spirit. There he received the gift of healing.<br /><br />

                He preached as an evangelist in many places after graduation. Later, while in the Middle East, in the year 2006, he was ordained as Pastor by the great man of God  Rev. Dr. Roger Hosma, Atlanta, USA. He is a tele-evangelist who preaches gospel in Surya, Asianet, Powervision, Harvest, etc. Wherever the pastor preaches the word of God, many are healed from diseases, delivered from their problems and experiencing repentance in their lives.<br /><br />

                He married Dr. Jeena Thomas(daughter of Thomas Mathew and Jolly Thomas)who chose full time ministry and dedicated her life for Jesus. They are blessed with two sons named Jeremiah and Nehemiah.<br /><br />

                He is the founder and Chairman of El- Shaddai Ministry and the Pastor of Jesus Is Alive Global Worship Centre, Kottarakara where thousands attend the Sunday Worship. He is also a spiritual father and mentor to many in different parts of the world. Now-a-Days as he is called for an Apostolic ministry, God sends him to parts of many countries in Asia, Europe, America & Australia such as Russia, New Zealand, USA, Middle East, UK including Scotland  to preach the word of God and win souls for God Almighty until He comes.
