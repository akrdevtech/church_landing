                <b>KINGDOM OF GOD</b> :

                <b>HOLY SPIRIT BAPTISM</b> :

                <br />
                <b>THE CHURCH</b> :
                We believe that the Church is the body of Christ called separated and prepared as his Bride and every born again believer should enjoy the fellowship of other believers in a local Church.
